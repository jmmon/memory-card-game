## bugfix: settings tooltips are below and cut off other things
- make a button that slides out the description! question mark button sgv,
    then it works on mobile as well. Flow down or however, 
    the size should adapt I think?

- developer settings:
> - Cancel button inside dropdown, to reset
    checkbox states to previous settings
> - border around dropdown items

- Reset Without Saving => Cancel & Reset (saves 6 chars!)
> - or 'Reset Game' and then 'Save & Reset' // no need for tooltips!

- move Played Time to top above Shuffle button, inside Stats box
> - also show Mismatches and Pairs, even if game isn't over yet

- Modal x button: remove border & bg, just have a simple x?
