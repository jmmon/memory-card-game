## developer settings:
- Cancel button inside dropdown
> - to reset checkbox states to previous settings
- border around dropdown items
- full width for checkbox rows 


## TODO: also show Mismatches and Pairs, even if game isn't over yet
> - e.g. if game has started, show the stats


## bug: if win modal is open, should not be able to open settings modal.
- currently it can open (using new escape keybind!!)
- opens behind the win modal; need to disable keybind when end-game modal is opened


## TODO: add dark mode? (darker mode)
- some shader over the cards front/back to darken them?
- or inverse them
- invert works but turns red to green, would be nice to keep red
