## bugfix: settings tooltips are below and cut off other things
- make a button that slides out the description! question mark button sgv,
    then it works on mobile as well. Flow down or however, 
    the size should adapt I think?

## developer settings:
- Cancel button inside dropdown
> - to reset checkbox states to previous settings
- border around dropdown items
- full width for checkbox rows 


## TODO: also show Mismatches and Pairs, even if game isn't over yet
> - e.g. if game has started, show the stats


## bug: play again
- if set on 6 cards, then win and play again, change to 18 cards
- next, open settings. Slider shows 6, even though 18 cards are on the board!
- (scores are properly resetting though so no issues there)

## bug: homepage > dev settings > card number slider
- tooltip css not applying
