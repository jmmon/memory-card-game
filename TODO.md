## bugfix: settings tooltips are below and cut off other things
- make a button that slides out the description! question mark button sgv,
    then it works on mobile as well. Flow down or however, 
    the size should adapt I think?

- developer settings:
> - Cancel button inside dropdown, to reset
    checkbox states to previous settings
> - border around dropdown items

- naming: 
> - or 'Reset Game' and then 'Save & Reset' // no need for tooltips on these!
DONE

- move Played Time to top above Shuffle button, inside Stats box
DONE
> - TODO: also show Mismatches and Pairs, even if game isn't over yet

- Modal x button: remove border & bg, just have a simple x?
DONE

- Settings: open with Esc key??
DONE

- bug: play again
- if set on 6 cards, then win and play again, it resets to 18 cards on the board
- next, open settings. Slider shows 6, even though 18 cards are on the board!
- (scores are properly resetting though so no issues there)



- BUG: Game End modal:
Play again does not reset mismatches/pairs!!
