## low priority: developer settings:
- Cancel button inside dropdown
> - to reset checkbox states to previous settings


## TODO: also show Mismatches and Pairs, even if game isn't over yet
> - e.g. if game has started, show the stats
> - having trouble with context for some reason...


## TODO: add dark mode? (darker mode)
- some shader over the cards front/back to darken them?
- or inverse them
- invert works but turns red to green, would be nice to keep red


## TODO: lock board / etc
- after saving game, if board is locked, do not let layout recalculate
